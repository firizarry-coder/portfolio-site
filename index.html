    <p>
        My name is Frances Irizarry. For many years I had worked in the food service industry. I had fun and met incredible people. Loved the idea that you create something and that other people would enjoyed.
        But it wasn't something I wanted to do for my whole life since the work was very physically and very work long hours. Until the idea came to me about how exciting and challenging would be if i make a career change to development. 
        Always found coding very fascinanting, even though I had never tried it. After putting that on hold and battling with imposter symdrome. I finally took the leap of faith and signed up to learn how to code. Ready to make the world a better place by solving problems and building solutions.
